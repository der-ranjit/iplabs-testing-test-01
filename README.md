## Your Task
Your task is to get an understanding of this app and write tests for it.
What to test is completely up to you and what you think should be tested.

### Hints
* The files containing tests need to be imported in `src/tests.ts`
* You can use `src/app/imageService.spec.ts` as a boilerplate for other tests
* To run the normal app, and not the testing environment, set `TEST_MODE` to `false` in the file `src/main.ts` and then save and reload.
